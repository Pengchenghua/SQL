--采购关联工厂、再关联入库批次表、最后关联销售获取销售数据

--第一步
--使用工厂生产数据通过工单加原料关联成本核算凭证明细表的原单号和商品，在凭证中原料和成品都会产生凭证，并且凭证号是一致的。
--通过获取的凭证号和商品再去关联物流的入库批次表，可以得到工厂加工商品的原料的采购订单号。
--这里取能关联出采购订单号的工厂生产数据，存在部分获取不到采购单号的数据。

--第二步
--在工厂加工关联到采购单号的基础上，用采购入库表去做关联，关联上的用工厂工单号做订单编码，工厂成品做商品编码，关联不上的
--直接用采购的采购订单做订单编码，采购商品编码做商品编码。

--第三步
--在第二步基础上，用选择好的订单编码，商品编码再次关联物流入库批次表，获取销售出库数据，拿到销售出库凭证号，
--再利用商品加凭证号，即可关联出销售数据
